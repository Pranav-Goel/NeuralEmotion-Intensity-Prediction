paiwise_correlation_test_1.ipynb		- 		This is the code for the experiment proposed in Section 6.1. This code will train our best performing proposed neural model on emotion i, and test on emotion j, as a way to see the pairwise correlation between emotions from the frame of emotion intensity detection task in tweets.

paiwise_correlation_test_2.ipynb	- 		This is the code for the experiment proposed in Section 6.2. This code will train our best performing proposed neural model on emotion i + emotion j (combined training sets), and test on emotion j, as a way to see the pairwise correlation between emotions from the frame of emotion intensity detection task in tweets
