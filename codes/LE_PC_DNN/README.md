LE_PC_DNN_complete.ipynb 	-		This is the code for the architecture proposed in Section 2. It combines *L*exicon-based features, pre-trained activations of a CNN trained for *E*moji detection in tweets, a CNN and fully connected layers in parallel (hence, it is a *P*arallely *C*onnected *D*eep *N*eural *N*etwork). Along with the full model, there is also code for some of the ablation tests.
